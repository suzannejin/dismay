Title: dismay: distance metrics for matrices
Version: 0.0.1
Description: dismay provides a common interface to calculate seventeen measures of association for matrices. Measures of association accessible through this common interface include standard correlations (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall), biweight midcorrelation, weighted rank correlation, a zero-inflated Kendall's tau, mutual information, the gene co-dependency index, Jaccard distance, cosine similarity, the Sorenson-Dice coefficient, Hamming distance, Canberra, Euclidean, and Manhattan distances, two symmetric measures of proportionality, and partial correlation.
